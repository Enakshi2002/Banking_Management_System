#Banking Management System
The Banking Management System is a Java-based application that helps manage accounts, transactions, and customer information efficiently. It allows banks to register customers, manage account details, process transactions (such as deposits, withdrawals, and transfers), and retrieve or update account information. The system uses MySQL as the database backend and JDBC for database connectivity.
