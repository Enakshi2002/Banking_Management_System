The Banking Management System is a Java-based application that helps manage accounts, transactions, and customer information efficiently. It allows banks to register customers, manage account details, process transactions (such as deposits, withdrawals, and transfers), and retrieve or update account information. The system uses MySQL as the database backend and JDBC for database connectivity.

✅ Create User Table
CREATE TABLE User (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    password VARCHAR(100)
);

    account_number BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    balance DOUBLE,
    security_pin VARCHAR(10)
);
4. Configure Database Connection
Update the database connection details in BankingApp.java:

java
Copy
Edit
private static final String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/bankdb";
private static final String username = "root";
private static final String password = "your-password";
5. Compile and Run

Build the project
Run the BankingApp.java file

# Flow Of Project
The Banking Management System allows users to register, login, and manage their bank accounts securely. Users can perform transactions such as deposit, withdrawal, and money transfer, while also checking their account balance. The system ensures data consistency using MySQL as the database and JDBC for connectivity. Transaction rollback mechanisms guarantee secure and reliable operations.
